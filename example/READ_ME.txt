Here I have provided 2 example scripts for how to use the functions in this tool box.

example_script_1 is a full pipeline of using 3 OPM sensors as reference points to register a subject mesh (e.g., MRI) into the OPM sensor space, which then is used to register in the model meshes

example_script_2 is from a dataset where the subject mesh scan is already in OPM sensor space and we only need to register the model meshes to this

create_geoms shows how a custom combination of the model meshes can be created
